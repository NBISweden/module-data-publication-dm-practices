## EBI Repository Wizard

[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) hosts several life science repositories, suitable for different types of data. The Repository Wizard helps to identify which one is suitable for your data.

* Go to the Wizard at [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/)

* Either explore the wizard with the purpose of finding a suitable repository for one of your projects, or choose among the scenarios provided below. Which repository is recommended?

  * Genomics project with RNA sequences
  * X-ray chrystollography structure of a protein
  * Gene expression data
  * Protein sequencing data
  * Proteomics project using mass spectrometry
  * Electron microscopy structure images

  > ## Solution
  > * Genomics project with RNA sequences: [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/submit) (DNA/RNA sequence -> no controlled access -> produced experimentally -> Other)
  > * X-ray chrystollography structure of a protein: [wwPDB OneDep](https://deposit-pdbe.wwpdb.org/deposition) (Structures -> X-ray chrystollography)
  > * Microarray gene expression data: [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/submit/overview.html) (Expression data -> no controlled access -> Microarray gene expression)
  > * Protein sequencing data: [UniProt SPIN](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Submissions/spin/) (Protein data -> no controlled access -> produced experimentally -> Protein sequencing)
  > * Proteomics project using mass spectrometry: [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/submitdatapage) (Protein data -> no controlled access -> produced experimentally -> Mass spectrometry -> Proteomics)
  > * Electron microscopy structure images: [EMPIAR](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/deposition/) (Structures-> Electron microscopy -> micrographs or particle stacks)
