## Exercise - make a data publication plan
During this exercise you will create a plan for making research data available to the public, by identifying a suitable repository and finding out what the requirements are for submission. Three data output scenarios will be presented, with different data types.

### The scenarios
<!-- for each project, present a brief description of the research question and the main outcomes; data types, excel sheets, analysis scripts? -->
1. Project A
2. Project B
3. Project C

### Data publication plan
Things to consider when making a data publication plan:
* What types of outputs will you be creating or collecting?
* What are suitable repositories for your outputs?
* What are the documentation guidelines for the repositories?
* What preparations are needed to make data and documentation (metadata) ready for submission?
* Under what licenses will your research outputs be shared?

#### Steps

##### What types of outputs will you be creating or collecting?
Make a list of the outputs, start with the main, most important, data type(s) for the study

* <data type>
* <data type>

##### What are suitable repositories for your outputs?
Depositing your data in a publicly accessible recognised repository which assigns a globally persistent identifier (e.g. a DOI) ensures that your dataset continues to be available to both humans and machines in a usable form in the future.
Try to identify suitable repositories for your main data type(s).

**Tools**
* [ELIXIR Deposition Databases for Biomolecular Data](https://www.elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases)
* [EBI Data submission Services](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/)
* [Scientific Data Repository Guidance](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#life)

**Repositories**
* <data type>: <repository>, <link>


##### What are the documentation guidelines for the repositories?
Repositories will often have documentation guidelines that are according to domain-relevant standards, which will improve the FAIRness of your data. Organising your output documentation according to these guidelines and standards from the start will make your FAIRification journey much easier.
List “documentation entities” that the repository will expect you to provide

<repository>
Study/project description : <link to information at repository>

##### What preparations are needed to make data and documentation (metadata) ready for submission?

##### Under what licenses will your research outputs be shared?
