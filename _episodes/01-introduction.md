## Why submit your datasets to a repository?
### What is data?
There are different types of data

* Raw: straight from the instrument eg fastq, bam, cram
* Processed: normalization, removal of outliers, expression measurements, statistics
* Metadata: minimum information to reproduce the data, sample information, precise protocols

### Why should I share my data?
* Open Science & FAIR
* Reproducibility
* Trail of evidence
* 3rd party access
* Archival
* Publication of paper requires it

## How to find a suitable repository
### Types of repositories
* Domain specific: 
    * Best choice if suitable, long-term plan, typically free of charge, maximum reach. 
    * E.g. ENA, ArrayExpress
* General purpose: 
    * Second best, long-term plan, might cost (now or in future), good reach but less specific in metadata â†’ more difficult for future users to judge if a dataset will be useful
    * E.g. Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad
* In house/institutional
    * For archive/backup purpose mainly, might cost, limited reach unless also published in data catalogue

### How find a domain specific repository?
* [EBI wizard](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) - guide depending on data type
* [ELIXIR deposition databases](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases) - core resources with long-term data preservation and accessibility plans
* [FAIRsharing.org/databases](https://fairsharing.org/databases/) - catalogue of many repositories, with possibility to filter on e.g. domain.
